# Lets-Steal
App made in a five hour Google CS Code sprint at IGDTUW. Badged first position amongst all BTech batches. Based on on the fractional Knapsack Problem.

The idea is to do the math and select the items such that that knapsack holds maximum possible profit.

Animations and audio files are added to make the experience better.
